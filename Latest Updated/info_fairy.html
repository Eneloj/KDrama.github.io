		<font id="name">Lee Sung-kyung as Kim Bok-joo</font>
		<p>A naturally gifted weightlifter with an ambitious and outgoing personality. While growing up with her father who was a former weightlifter, she got inspired to do the same thing. She stands up for injustice as well–although she still feels shyness and awkwardness around boys, she not hesitate to beat them up if they provoke her. She hides her insecurities and fragile heart under her strong exterior</p>

		<font id="name1">Nam Joo-hyuk as Jung Joon-hyung</font>
		<p>He is Kim Bok-joo's childhood friend from when they were in elementary school. Both Kim Bok-Joo and himself didn't recognize nor remember each other, until an incident occurred that dug up memories. A talented swimmer with a playful personality, he suffers from a trauma that began when he realized that the postcards being sent to him by his mother were actually from his aunt and uncle. This event coincided with his first big international tournament, and as a result, he made a false start due to a panic attack and got disqualified. He enjoys teasing Bok-Joo, and later falls in love with her.</p>

She is a top-class rhythmic gymnast, who won a silver medal at the Asian Games at the age of eighteen. Shi-ho is an overachiever, and is under constant stress about her weight and skills, which caused her to break up with Joon-hyung, and act rashly in various situations.</p>
