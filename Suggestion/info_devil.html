		<p>Devilish Joy (or Devilish Charm) is a romantic comedy about a doctor (Choi Jin Hyuk) suffering from “Cinderella Amnesia” where his memory only lasts one day and then resets who falls in love with a washed up actress (Song Ha Yoon).

		Devilish Joy is one of those dramas that has about every cliché in the book: white truck of doom, amnesia, evil mother figures, childhood trauma, and a host of others.  But it throws them all together in a pretty entertaining story with an adorable romance, humor, and a decent plot.</p></div>
