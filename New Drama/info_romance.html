		<font id="name">Lee Na-young as Kang Dan-i (37 years old) </font>
		<p>She is 37 years old. She has high qualification for jobs with a career with much experience. She was once a successful publisher, but she became penniless and lost her senses at work. She will do everything to get a job. She got divorced last year (she also has a daughter) and she has nothing now: no husband, no house, no money, and no youth. Her heart started to beat again after a decade because of two younger guys.</p>

		<font id="name1">Lee Jong-suk as Cha Eun-ho (32 years old)</font>
		<p>He is 32 years old. He is a genius writer and the youngest chief editor at the publishing company. People call him “The emerging star in the writers’ guild”. He makes hearts flutter with his cynical attitude and his warm and soft appearance. He has his unique charms. He knew the DangYi from the past and she is the one that brought him into the writer path and also made him not trust in love. He could not believe it when she came for an interview at his publishing company. He was thinking “A graduate from a famous university, why is she pretending to only have a high-school diploma? Is she a divorcee?”. He also started to get jealous when another man in the company started to show her interest.</p>
